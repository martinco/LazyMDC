# Data Card Builder v2.

This is a Mission Data Card (MDC) generator / builder for DCS with support for importing routes, loadouts and more from CombatFlite or routes from Google Earth, editing navigation waypoints, assigning loadout (including weights) and custom images for notes secctions and more.

It generates multi-page PDF or per-page PNG files that are suitable for immediate kneeboard use within DCS and includes an [A-10C CDU DataLoader](https://www.virtual-jabog32.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=11569) compatible file when the A-10C is selected

It was born out of a desire to make my own life easier building MDCs in a reasonable timeframe and I hope you find it of use!
