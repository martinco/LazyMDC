      MDC Data Loader

    <p>
      This is a small application which can automatically enter waypoints for
      the F/A-18C using the mdc-loader.json which is supplied with the PDF /
      PNG download zip archive

      This is <b>*very*</b> alpha at the moment and the source will be put on github in due course
      <ul>
        <li>Currently only supports F/A-18C
        <li>All valid waypoints will be entered<ul>
          <li>Invalid or empty waypoints will be ignroed and skipped
          <li>It will continue to enter next waypoint gaps in the MDC will be honored in-pit
        </ul>
        <li>Waypoints will be entered starting at the currently selected waypoint
          <ul>
            <li>To ensure consistency, ensure WP0 is selected (default at startup)
            <li>If you wish to skip WP 0 (e.g. loading prior to alignment), have a blank item on the waypoints page and it will be skipped on data entry
          </ul>
        <li>Bullseye will be loaded into WP59 (why having WP0 selected is important for this)
        <li>Sequence currently uses all valid waypoints and ignores what's in the sequence box
          <ul>
            <li>When I update the Waypoints tab to manually create sequences these will be honored 
            <li>Right now as a free-form text entry box it's too much data sanitation 
          </ul>
